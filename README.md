I am a Management information systems student and minoring in data science.

In the past three months, I have been working for workiva on the client services team and taking classes at Iowa State University

The three most important tools/strategies I use to organize my work are :

* microsoft onenote for taking notes in class and grouping slides and handouts.
* git for version control when working on code base work
* google drive or office 365 to collaberate with classmate on class presentations
